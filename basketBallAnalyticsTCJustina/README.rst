This Python application is a Basketball Analytics Tracker built with the tkinter library, designed to record and analyze a team's and individual players' statistics. It allows users to add, remove, and track various on-court events for players, including basic stats (points, assists, rebounds, turnovers, and different shot types), advanced metrics (PER, TS%, A/T ratio, Usage%, and BPM), and specific basketball actions like strike zone passing, cuts, paint touches allowed, and defensive outcomes. All data is persisted to a JSON file, and the application includes features for undoing the last action, editing totals, generating a full team report, and exporting data to a CSV file.
